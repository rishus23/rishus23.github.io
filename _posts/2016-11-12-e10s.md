Making mozilla better and supporting the web awareness has always been our mission. This time with the release of Firefox 50-beta we had to check its performance and compatibility with multiprocess.

It was Oct 29 and we the members of Mozilla kolkata community gathered for the event **e10s & Featured Add-ons testing** to make Firefox 50 awesome. With the emergence of multiprocess Firefox (e10s), it was needed to ensure these spotlighted add-ons meet the highest levels of browser compatibility and functionality.  

We were a total of 12 members with a few newcomers. The event started with the introduction round
and guiding the newcomers about the mozilla mission and workflow. Biraj sir and Subhashish sir 
were explaining the task we had to perform that day, everyone seemed pretty excited for the event.

We had to install add-ons and test their features to ensure the content works as expected with multiprocess Firefox. The main point was that with more compatible add-ons, e10s will roll out faster to potentially millions more Firefox users. Steps to perform the task could be found [here](https://activate.mozilla.community/e10s-addons/). We had to test the add-ons and then update the tested results in our common [ethernet pad](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/remo-e10s-and-featured-add-ons-testing).

Things were going on smooth untill we encountered a problem with the _*multiprocess activation*_. I won't be going through the details of the problem but we reported the bug and not much later got the fix. Report of the problem could be found [here](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/activate-mozilla-e10s-compatibility-and-featured-add-ons/11193/16).  
Hashtags #mozactivate and #e10s were floating over the internet. Everyone of us were being guided 
properly by Biraj sir. There was also an arrangement for the lunch. So, we had our lunch and then followed a little talk with the newcomers and about next meetups.

We resumed our work again and by the end of the event we successfully tested over 80+ add-ons.
All the attendees made the event productive. We had to test some of the remaining add-ons at home.

This was my first add-on testing event and I liked it, also I learned alot.
We tested alot of add-ons, list can be found in our ethernet pad. We had a 4 hours long event.
